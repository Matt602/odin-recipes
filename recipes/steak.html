        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Black Pepper</li>
            <li>Sprig of rosemary or thyme</li>
            <li>A third of a stick of butter</li>
            <li>2 or 3 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>Vegetable or canola oil</li>
            <li>Thick cut of ribeye steak(preferably choice  or prime grade)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Take the steak out of refrigerator for 10 minutes before cooking</li>
            <li>Season both sides of steak with a dash of salt and some black pepper</li>
            <li>Grab a cast iron skillet or stainless steel pan</li>
            <li>Turn on stove to about between medium and high heat</li>
            <li>Put pan on heat until it starts to smoke. So about 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Add oil to pan</li>
            <li>Immediately add the steak on to pan</li>
            <li>After about 4 minutes, grab a set of tongs and place the steak on the pan 
                so that the fat strip of the steak can be rendered down. Hold it for about 
                2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Then place the uncooked side of the steak on the pan for another 4 minutes</li>
            <li>Drain the oil from the pan.</li>
            <li>Turn the stove to low heat.</li>
            <li>Add the butter, rosemary, and garlic cloves to pan. Wait about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Put the rosemary, or thyme, and garlic on top of steak.</li>
            <li>Then grab a spoon and carefully tilt the pan to allow melted butter to collect
                to a side of the pan. Start pouring the butter on to steak to baste it. 
                Do this for about 3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Finally, turn the stove off, take the steak off the pan, and let it rest
                for about 10 minutes before eating.
            </li>
        </ol>
